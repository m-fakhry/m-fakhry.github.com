context, domain knowledge, and data-driven modeling of complex phenomena based on observations that are highly structured and interdependent is a very challenging task. In this project we address this problem by using the structured predictive modeling framework based on a probabilistic exponential graphical model instead of relying on traditional statistical approaches that assume independent and identically distributed random variables. Current state-of-the-art predictive modeling techniques usually cannot deal with such large and complex networks; thus we provide knowledge-based compression techniques for complexity reduction. We use multiple kinds of domain knowledge and context to capture additional information that might be missing from the observed data. We also directly constrain the model optimization based on domain constraints and embed other problem-specific qualitative knowledge directly into the framework. The main innovation of this project is extending our structured learning models to explore in detail the hypothesis that a unified approach of integrating big data with sources of high-level knowledge (ontologies, domain-based constraints etc.) is beneficial for predictive modeling of complex phenomena.

Description The construction of a new middleware for NSGB, an intermediary tier that shields legacy systems from being transparent to retail and customer-serving delivery channels, was part of this project. The main responsibility of the middleware is to receive requests from the frontend, parse the information from these requests, send inquiries to the backend, receive replies back, process the replies and apply some logic, and finally return the results to the requester. Along with managing the project (resource management, mission planning, logistics, status reports, financial control, etc.), participating in the feasibility study to design the project, and participating in the technical design of the required software changes (specifications and programming support), I was also implementing the middleware’s core functionality.
